# Little Pig Control - ROS Package

This repository is meant for all the control based code **only**. Example's of such:
- Mapping a game controller to the controls of the simulated/real little pig.

This works with standard xbox one controllers.  Some generic controllers seem to work correctly most of the time but have shown notable differences between systems.  The mapping shown below is for standard xbox controllers but mapping generic controllers can be done using jstest-gtk to determine button layout.

### Using Teleop to drive Little Pig

#### In order to drive the vehicle with controller you must have "joy" and "teleop_twist_joy". If you do not have them run the following.

- sudo apt install ros-melodic-joy
- sudo apt install ros-melodic-teleop-twist-joy

#### If using wired the map is as follows
- param name="axis_angular" value="3"
- param name="enable_turbo_button" value="4"  THIS IS LB
- param name="enable_button" value="5"        THIS IS RB

#### If using bluetooth the map is as follows
- param name="axis_angular" value="2"
- param name="enable_turbo_button" value="6"  THIS IS LB
- param name="enable_button" value="7"        THIS IS RB

### Using CANopen 402

This node needs passed the robot name to search for robot description on param server  
  
This node needs passed a motor_driver.yaml file with the bus parameters as well as all specifics of the motors  
- This driver file can also handle dual motor drives as demonstrated in the yaml file
- This driver file needs a interval time to set update rate
- This driver file can also be given parameters to send out a heartbeat message
- List all difference CAN devices as nodes:
- Underneath nodes, designate a name and then also, you need to pass eds file and the ros package where it is located  
- Each motor needs passed the joint name and can set parameters for vel, pos, and eff to and from the device. These parameters can be designated using inline calculations

### Using Generic Controller

This launch file is intended to load the designated controller in the file.  
In our case, this file add params for the ackermann controller

### Using Full launch (ALL OTHER REPOSITORIES NEED TO BE CURRENT BEFORE THIS)

This launch file is intended to load the entire pig and all necessary components. This includes

#### When Simulation param was true
- Robot decription was already uploaded to param server
- Launches Empty world in Gazebo
- Calls simulation launch from gazebo and spawns the robot into model. Also loads the controller  
gains for gazebo as well as the ackermann config and the control yaml is used to publish joint states
- Calls teleop launch to control the vehicle
- Calls a static_tf to link the front and rear laser to the chassis
- Launches rviz using the full_sim rviz config file
- Launches gmapping node to build map
- Launches robot localization node for the odom to base_link transform
- Launches robot localization node for the odom to map transform
- Launches navsat to for the map to utm transform

#### When Simulation param is false
- Uploads the robot to the param server
- CANopen 402 launches the parameters to the server
- Loads the controller params to the server
- Loads teleop to control the vehicle
- Launches mavros for IMU & GPS
- Launches robot localization node for the odom to base_link transform
- Launches robot localization node for the odom to map transform
- Launches navsat to for the map to utm transform
- Launches LiDAR node for scan
